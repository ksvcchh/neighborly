# Neighborly — A Community Services Exchange

## Core Concept
Imagine a platform where neighbors can request and offer small services (e.g., dog walking, lawn care, tutoring, tech help) within their local community. The app uses a credit or points system (or simple payments) so that people can “earn” credits when they help others and “spend” credits on services they need. The backend uses Flask to handle user and service management, while the Next.js frontend provides a smooth, modern user interface.

## Target User
- Individuals living in dense neighborhoods or apartment complexes who want to offer or request occasional help.  
- Busy professionals who need reliable, local assistance.  
- Retirees or students looking to earn extra income or gain experience in certain skill areas.

## Main Features
1. **User Profiles & Reputation**  
   Registered users can set up a profile with skills offered and see a rating/review system reflecting service quality.

2. **Service Listings & Requests**  
   Users create or browse service listings (“Tutor for 1 hour,” “Help with moving furniture,” etc.) with descriptions, time estimates, and location details.

3. **Credits System or Payment Integration**  
   Users earn and spend credits for completed services or can use standard payments.

4. **Real-Time Messaging & Notifications**  
   Built-in messaging for scheduling details, clarifications, and real-time notifications when services are requested or accepted.

5. **Search & Filtering**  
   Filter by service type (e.g., pet care, lawn care, tutoring), availability, and user rating to find the right match quickly.

## Why It’s Valuable
1. **Solves a Real Need**  
   Fosters community engagement and satisfies everyday service needs more locally, often cheaper and more reliably than large-scale gig apps.

2. **Nontrivial Business Logic**  
   The credits/payment system, rating/review workflows, and real-time communication create a rich, hands-on development challenge.

3. **Portfolio-Worthy Complexity**  
   Showcases full-stack expertise (Flask backend, Next.js frontend), authentication, payments or credits, live chats, and robust filtering—enough complexity to demonstrate strong professional skills.
